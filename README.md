# Khoury_Student_Reigster_System
In today's world, student course registration and management are becoming increasingly important. That's why we've designed a student course registration and management system based on GitHub. This system aims to help students register for courses they're interested in more easily, as well as help teachers manage and track students' learning progress more effectively.

The system features include the following:

Students can register for courses they're interested in on GitHub, including course names, teacher names, course times, and receive reminders before courses begin.

Students can easily view their registered courses and related information, as well as cancel registered courses.

Teachers can conveniently view the students who have registered for the course, and track their learning progress and grades at any time.

Teachers can publish course information, assignments, exams, and schedules on GitHub so that students can stay informed about relevant information.

The system has user management and identity authentication features to ensure that only authenticated users can access relevant information.

The system's advantages include its use of GitHub's platform and tools, which provide excellent scalability and maintainability. Additionally, the use of open-source technology and communities helps promote and improve the system. Furthermore, the system's implementation offers high flexibility and customization, allowing for adjustments and optimizations based on different needs.
